## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- React Native development environment
- Android Studio / Xcode for device testing

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foxspot.git
   cd foxspot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   
   Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

   ```sql
   -- Events table
   CREATE TABLE events (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     title TEXT NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     location TEXT NOT NULL,
     address TEXT NOT NULL,
     lat DECIMAL NOT NULL,
     lng DECIMAL NOT NULL,
     type TEXT NOT NULL,
     date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
     image_url TEXT,
     created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create policies for events
   CREATE POLICY "Events are viewable by everyone" ON events
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can create events" ON events
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own events" ON events
     FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = created_by);
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

6. **Run on device/simulator**
   - Install Expo Go app on your mobile device
   - Scan the QR code from the terminal
   - Or press `a` for Android emulator, `i` for iOS simulator
